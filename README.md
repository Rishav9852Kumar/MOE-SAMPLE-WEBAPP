# Getting Started with Moenage Integration

This project showcases the integration of [React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [Moengage](https://www.moengage.com/).

## Featured Scripts

In the project directory, you have:

### `Track Button Clicked Event`
Tracks any button-click event in the app and integrates with Moengage SDK to store this event. You can see a successful event tracking via a toast message.

### `User-Details Update Event`
Logs the updating of user details. A toast message will let you know when user details have successfully been updated.

### `Log In and Log Out`
Allows logging in and out of user sessions. These events are also destroyed and tracked by Moengage SDK. Logs of these events can be viewed through toast messages.

### `User Attribute Customization`
There is a feature to customize user attributes. This feature considers the data type and ensures the input matches the chosen data type before committing the changes. Moengage SDK tracks these customization changes.

## `Available Scripts`

You can initialize the project using the following commands:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
